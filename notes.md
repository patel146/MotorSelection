use **71%** throttle for dead battery

assume same power consumption (naive assumption)

motor kv -> rpm per volt at full throttle (assume motor speed is prop to the voltage at full throttle)

linear stuff is high key sus

(Model dead battery performance, get an idea of minimum voltage before we can't fly it anymore)
(field test with payload, hold altitude)

**_ see performance at end of flight battery _**

Hover vs cruise --> how much more thrust will we need?

6s battery full 4.2 25.2 V -> 3V/cell => 18 --- 5s ->
Work with voltages

Look at 21 V for cutoff
How much battery needed for safe landing?
Battery cutoff for new round of fillings?

Invite Duncan and UUARG to final presentation for ENGM670

**_ detailed quickstart guide (readme) _**

TO DO: (1-2 weeks)

- cruise vs. hover (how much more thrust is needed)
- check the low battery performance (71% throttle) - use interpolation
- 10% safety factor vs. 0% safety factor

AFTER ORDERING:

- combine batteries in mixed configurations
- look at specific energy of battery

need
budget -> 2600 left (1600 raw 1100)

- current around 1200

TODO
create battery spreadsheet with:
Specfic energy,
specific cost,
link to datasheet,
criteria: under 100Wh (per battery),
find cost of splitting capacity (mass of connector and cabling)
check c rating (check minimum number of batteries on P/T to maintain good C rating)
check 3Ah and 4Ah batteries for perspective (check densities)
if manufacturer gives total energy, could be good to use (input some uncertainty)

prioritize canadian suppliers
check for direct from Hong Kong warehouses (called global warehouse)

- be consistent across battery chemistries (LiPo vs. Nm)
  note: Phoenix is backup for Trident (keep under 100)

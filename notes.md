use **71%** throttle for dead battery

assume same power consumption (naive assumption)

motor kv -> rpm per volt at full throttle (assume motor speed is prop to the voltage at full throttle)

linear stuff is high key sus 

(Model dead battery performance, get an idea of minimum voltage before we can't fly it anymore)
(field test with payload, hold altitude)

*** see performance at end of flight battery ***

Hover vs cruise --> how much more thrust will we need?

6s battery full 4.2 25.2 V -> 3V/cell => 18 --- 5s -> 
Work with voltages

Look at 21 V for cutoff
How much battery needed for safe landing?
Battery cutoff for new round of fillings?

*** detailed quickstart guide (readme) ***

TO DO: (1-2 weeks)
- cruise vs. hover (how much more thrust is needed) 
- check the low battery performance (71% throttle) - use interpolation 
- 10% safety factor vs. 0% safety factor

AFTER ORDERING:
- combine batteries in mixed configurations
- look at specific energy of battery

check c rating
need
budget -> 2600 left (1600 raw 1100)
- current around 1200
